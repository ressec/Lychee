day.SATURDAY.description=Saturday is the day of the week between Friday and Sunday. The Romans named Saturday SÄ turni diÄ“s ("Saturn's Day") no later than the 2nd century for the planet Saturn, which controlled the first hour of that day, according to Vettius Valens. The day's name was introduced into West Germanic languages and is recorded in the Low German languages such as Middle Low German sater(s)dach, Middle Dutch saterdag (Modern Dutch zaterdag) and Old English SÃ¦tern(es)dÃ¦Ä¡ and SÃ¦terdÃ¦Ä¡. In Old English, Saturday was also known as sunnanÃ¦fen ("sun" + "eve" cf. dialectal German Sonnabend).
day.MONDAY.description=Monday is the day of the week between Sunday and Tuesday. According to the international standard ISO 8601 it is the first day of the week. In countries that adopt the "Sunday-first" convention, it is the second day of the week. The name of Monday is derived from Old English MÅ nandÃ¦g and Middle English Monenday, originally a translation of Latin dies lunae "day of the Moon".

day.definition=A day is approximately the period during which the Earth completes one rotation around its axis, which takes around 24 hours. A solar day is the length of time which elapses between the Sun reaching its highest point in the sky two consecutive times. Days on other planets are defined similarly and vary in length due to differing rotation periods, that of Mars being slightly longer and sometimes called a sol.
day.WEDNESDAY.description=Wednesday is the day of the week between Tuesday and Thursday. According to international standard ISO 8601 it is the third day of the week. In countries that have Friday as their holiday and in some Muslim countries, Wednesday would be the fourth day of the week. In countries that use the Sunday-first convention and in the Jewish Hebrew calendar Wednesday is defined as the fourth day of the week. In English, the name is derived from Old English WÅ dnesdÃ¦g and Middle English Wednesdei, "day of Woden", reflecting the religion practised by the Anglo-Saxons, the English equivalent to the Norse god Odin. In some other languages, such as the French mercredi or Italian mercoledÃ¬, the day's name is a calque of dies Mercurii "day of Mercury".
day.FRIDAY.description=Friday is the day of the week between Thursday and Saturday. In countries adopting the "Monday-first" convention it is the fifth day of the week. In countries that adopt the "Sunday-first" convention, it is the sixth day of the week. In most Western countries, Friday is the fifth and final day of the working week. In some other countries, Friday is the first day of the weekend, with Saturday the second. In Israel, Friday is the sixth day of the week. In Iran, Friday is the last day of the weekend, with Saturday as the first day of the working week. Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Saudi Arabia and Kuwait also followed this convention until they changed to a Fridayâ€“Saturday weekend on September 1, 2006 in Bahrain and the UAE and a year later in Kuwait. In Iran, Thursday and Friday are weekend days.
day.SUNDAY.description=Sunday is the day of the week between Saturday and Monday. Sunday is a day of rest in most Western countries, and a part of the weekend. In some Eastern countries such as Israel Sunday is a weekday. For most observant Christians, Sunday is observed as a day of worship and rest, holding it as the Lord's Day and the day of Christ's resurrection; in the United States, Canada, China, Japan and the Philippines, as well as in South America, Sunday is the first day of the week. According to the Hebrew calendar and traditional calendars (including Christian calendars) Sunday is the first day of the week; Quaker Christians call Sunday the "first day" in accordance with their testimony of simplicity. The International Organization for Standardization ISO 8601, which is based in Switzerland, calls Sunday the seventh day of the week.

According to some commonly used calendars, however, especially in the United States, Sunday is the first day of the week, so Tuesday is the third day of the week. The English name is derived from Old English TiwesdÃ¦g and Middle English Tewesday, meaning "TÄ«w's Day", the day of Tiw or TÃ½r, the god of single combat, and law and justice in Norse mythology. Tiw was equated with Mars in the interpretatio germanica, and the name of the day is a translation of Latin dies Martis.
